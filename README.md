# API Rest Movies

![Node.js Logo](https://nodejs.org/static/images/logo.svg)

This project is a Rest API created by [eloygar](https://github.com/eloygar) with the aim of learning to use Node.js and Express.js. The API allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a movie database.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built with Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows us to run JavaScript code on the server, which allows us to build back-end applications with JavaScript.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A web application framework for Node.js designed to build web applications and APIs.
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid): For the generation of unique IDs.
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon): Utility that monitors any changes in the source code and automatically restarts the server.

## Installation

To install all the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm start
```
To stop the server, simply press `CTRL + C` n your terminal.

## Testing

It is recommended to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API.

## Node.js Installation

If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from [aqu√≠](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  After installation, you can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:


```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
These commands should display the versions of Node.js and npm respectively.
